# Portfolio Site

This repository contains the code for my personal portfolio site, hosted at TBD

Its purpose is to show the kind of highly pollished codebase I can design, while also
showing competency in several web technologies.

This site takes advantage of the following frameworks and libraries:

* Vue.JS
* Webpack
* TypeScript
* Axios
