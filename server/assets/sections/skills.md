#### Web Technologies

**React:** I learned React with classes while taking a full stack web development class in College but went on to learn how to use the frameworks new hook feature outside of school. Hooks make the development process significantly easier and fix many of the common problems with classes. Combined with TypeScript, React is an amazingly pleasant framework to work with.

**Vue:** This framework was what got me interested in doing web development. While I am still working on learning the composition API, Vue 2 is far easier to learn and use than React before hooks.

**Node.JS:** Makes developing applications much easier by using the save language as on the front end. With Express as a framework, this back end stays out of the developers way and makes creating complex web applications or API's a breeze.

#### Databases

**Postgres:** A favourite of the open source community, Postgres does not disapoint. I chose to become familiar with this database because of its simplicity to setup on Linux. I currently run my own Postgres server on a RPI, and use it for almost all of my projects.

**MongoDB:** When SQL is not the right fit, Mongo is always the first I reach for. With its BSON notation, it makes writing web applications easy to get off the ground, and the company also offers free hosting to get started.

#### Favourite Languages

**Linux:** C and Haskell

**Web:** JavaScript

**General Purpose:** Java
